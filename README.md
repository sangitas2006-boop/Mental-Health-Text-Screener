The proposed system is a browser-based hybrid stress screening platform designed to provide early awareness of psychological stress through multimodal analysis. The workflow begins with real-time facial image acquisition using the user’s webcam via the WebRTC getUserMedia API. The captured video stream is processed locally in the browser using the face-api.js framework, which employs a pretrained lightweight convolutional neural network for face detection and facial expression recognition. The model identifies primary emotional expressions such as happy, neutral, sad, angry, and surprised, generating an affective indicator that reflects the user’s visible emotional state at the time of screening. This facial emotion output is treated as a supportive signal rather than a dominant diagnostic factor.

Following facial analysis, the system presents a structured stress self-assessment questionnaire consisting of eighteen questions inspired by standardized psychometric instruments such as the Perceived Stress Scale and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Each question uses a Likert-scale response pattern to measure the frequency and intensity of stress-related experiences. In addition to structured responses, the system provides an open-ended text field where users can describe their feelings in their own words, enabling personal self-expression and enhancing user engagement. The questionnaire responses are scored to compute a baseline stress index, which is then combined with a small weighted adjustment derived from the detected facial expression to generate a final hybrid stress score on a normalized 0–100 scale.

The computed stress score is categorized into low, moderate, or high stress levels, and the corresponding result is displayed with appropriate explanatory feedback. All processing, including deep learning inference and stress scoring, is executed entirely on the client side using HTML and CSS without reliance on external servers or databases. This design ensures real-time responsiveness, cross-device compatibility, and complete preservation of user privacy, making the system suitable for scalable, accessible, and ethical mental health awareness applications.
